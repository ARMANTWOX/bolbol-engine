# bolbol-engine (minimal)

i added a minimal OpenGL renderer under `opengl/` and changed `main.cpp` that opens a GLFW window and draws a rotating triangle.

Notes:
- this is intentionally minimal. The renderer currently draws a single rotating colored triangle. use this as a starting point to add meshes, textures, and a scene graph.
- if your editor shows include errors, ensure include paths are set in your IDE and dependencies (glad, glfw, glm) are available.

i am stupid dont trust me
